          A clear-eyed look at the reported $50M blowup tied to David Chau, aka
          Captain Condor, and how a "safe" options strategy can spiral out of
          control when it is paired with reckless sizing.
        </p>

        <h2>Who is "Captain Condor"?</h2>
        <p>
          This story follows a cohort of retail traders who rallied around a leader
          often referred to as David Chau. The group ran the same strategy on the
          S&P 500 (SPX) every day and treated it as a dependable income engine.
        </p>
        <p>The key idea was simple:</p>
        <ul>
          <li><strong>The trade itself:</strong> an iron condor can be risk-defined.</li>
          <li><strong>The loss management:</strong> sizing up after losses turns it dangerous.</li>
        </ul>
        <p>
          So the strategy was not dangerous because iron condors are "evil." It was
          dangerous because of how the group responded after losing.
        </p>

        <h2>What a Martingale Really Is</h2>
        <p>
          A martingale is simple: you lose, you double down, and you keep doubling
          until you win so you net a single unit of profit. The framing here comes
          from <a href="https://www.volsignals.com/">VolSignals'</a> video, which makes the point cleanly: martingale only
          works if you have infinite capital and no betting limits. Real markets have
          margin constraints, liquidity limits, and risk caps, so the strategy
          eventually runs into the loss streak that wipes you out.
        </p>

        <h2>Options 101 in plain English</h2>
        <p>
          If you have never traded options, think of them as time-limited contracts
          on a stock or index. A call lets the buyer profit if price goes up, while a
          put lets the buyer profit if price goes down. The seller collects a premium
          up front and takes the obligation if the buyer exercises the contract.

        <h2>How an iron condor works</h2>
        <p>
          An iron condor sells a call spread above the current price and a put spread
          below it. The trader collects premium and hopes the price stays in the
          middle. The profit is capped, and losses begin if price escapes the range.
        </p>
        <p>
          A common "5-point wide" example is selling the 6900 call and buying the
          6905 call. That 5-point width caps the maximum loss on that side (minus the
          premium collected). The same structure sits below the market with puts.

            The flat zone is where the condor earns premium. A fast move beyond the
            range turns those small gains into growing losses.

          <li><strong>Hold for time decay.</strong> Profit if price stays between the strikes.</li>
        </ol>
        <div class="post-callout">
          <h3>Why it looks "safe" on paper</h3>
          <ul>
            <li><strong>No unlimited loss:</strong> the spread width caps worst-case risk.</li>
            <li><strong>Premium up front:</strong> you collect cash immediately.</li>
            <li><strong>Only one side loses:</strong> price can only finish above or below.</li>
          </ul>
        </div>

        <h2>Why Iron Condors Look Safe (But Aren't, When You Scale Them)</h2>
        <p>
          The mechanics are straightforward: sell an out-of-the-money put spread and
          sell an out-of-the-money call spread. Collect premium if price stays between
          the strikes. As VolSignals notes, a 5-point wide iron condor on SPX is about
          as safe as option selling gets. Max loss is defined: $5 per contract minus
          credit. Market inside the condor is a win. Market outside is a loss.
        </p>
        <ul>
          <li><strong>Defined risk per contract.</strong> The spread width caps the loss on each side.</li>
          <li><strong>Undefined risk per behavior (martingale sizing).</strong> Escalating size turns a capped loss into portfolio catastrophe.</li>
          <li><strong>Tail risk + gap risk + trend days make repeated losses inevitable.</strong> When the streak hits, the sizing amplifies it.</li>
        </ul>

        <h2>The stats trap they relied on (and why it is misleading)</h2>
        <p>
          The cohort leaned on the idea that roughly 67% to 68% of the time, price
          finishes within one standard deviation of the expected move. That is a
          classic probability assumption from normal distributions.
        </p>
        <p>But real markets do not behave like clean statistical machines:</p>
        <ul>
          <li>Fat tails and sudden jumps show up more often than the model expects.</li>
          <li>Trend days break tidy ranges.</li>
          <li>Holiday liquidity can distort pricing and spreads.</li>
        </ul>
        <p>
          They treated SPX like a casino game with stable odds. It is not.
        </p>

        <h2>The scaling is what killed them</h2>
        <p>
          The system used four levels of sizing: 1 spread, 5 spreads, 17 spreads, and
          53 spreads. In the real market example, those ratios ballooned into tens of
          thousands of contracts.

            <span class="ladder-note">17 spreads</span>

            <span class="ladder-note">53 spreads</span>
            <span class="ladder-detail">53x risk</span>
          </div>
        </div>
        <p>
          Even though each trade is defined risk, the total position risk explodes
          after a few losses. A short losing streak makes size go vertical.
        </p>
        <p>
          That scaling collides with a narrow win range. In a 5-wide condor, once
          price breaches a wing, you are quickly approaching max loss at expiration.
          With size this huge, the market does not need a crash. It just needs to
          drift into the wrong zone and stay there.
        </p>
        <p>
          This was not "bad luck." The distribution of SPX outcomes eventually
          touches your wings and martingale guarantees you are biggest right before
          it happens.
        </p>

        <h2>Gamma &amp; Charm: Why the Market Didn't "Have To" Mean-Revert</h2>
        <p>
          Gamma is dDelta/dSpot, how dealer delta changes per $1 move. Charm is
          dDelta/dTime, how delta changes as time passes. These flows force hedging
          behavior:
        </p>
        <ul>
          <li><strong>Positive gamma:</strong> stabilizes, encourages mean reversion.</li>
          <li><strong>Negative gamma:</strong> destabilizes, trends, and accelerates.</li>
        </ul>
        <p>
          When you are short condor wings, negative gamma zones are lethal. Moves can
          cascade, so your short strikes get tested faster than "normal." In 0DTE and
          short-dated books, hedging can push price into pain zones, pinning is never
          guaranteed, and you should not bet survival on "it should stop here."
