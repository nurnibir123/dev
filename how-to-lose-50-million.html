        <h1>How to Lose $50 Million</h1>
        <p class="lede">
          A clear-eyed look at the reported $50M blowup tied to David Chau, aka
          Captain Condor, and how a "safe" options strategy can spiral out of
          control when it is paired with reckless sizing.
        </p>
      </section>

      <main class="post">
        <h2>Who/what is "Captain Condor"?</h2>
        <p>
          This story follows a cohort of retail traders who rallied around a leader
          often referred to as David Chau. The group ran the same strategy on the
          S&P 500 (SPX) every day and treated it as a dependable income engine.
        </p>
        <p>The key idea was simple:</p>
        <ul>
          <li><strong>The trade itself:</strong> an iron condor can be risk-defined.</li>
          <li><strong>The loss management:</strong> sizing up after losses turns it dangerous.</li>
        </ul>
        <p>
          So the strategy was not dangerous because iron condors are "evil." It was
          dangerous because of how the group responded after losing.
        </p>

        <h2>Options 101 in plain English</h2>
        <p>
          If you have never traded options, think of them as time-limited contracts
          on a stock or index. A call lets the buyer profit if price goes up, while a
          put lets the buyer profit if price goes down. The seller collects a premium
          up front and takes the obligation if the buyer exercises the contract.
        </p>

        <h2>How an iron condor works</h2>
        <p>
          An iron condor sells a call spread above the current price and a put spread
          below it. The trader collects premium and hopes the price stays in the
          middle. The profit is capped, and losses begin if price escapes the range.
        </p>
        <p>
          A common "5-point wide" example is selling the 6900 call and buying the
          6905 call. That 5-point width caps the maximum loss on that side (minus the
          premium collected). The same structure sits below the market with puts.

            The flat zone is where the condor earns premium. A fast move beyond the
            range turns those small gains into growing losses.

          <li><strong>Hold for time decay.</strong> Profit if price stays between the strikes.</li>
        </ol>
        <div class="post-callout">
          <h3>Why it looks "safe" on paper</h3>
          <ul>
            <li><strong>No unlimited loss:</strong> the spread width caps worst-case risk.</li>
            <li><strong>Premium up front:</strong> you collect cash immediately.</li>
            <li><strong>Only one side loses:</strong> price can only finish above or below.</li>
          </ul>
        </div>

        <h2>So how did a "safe" structure turn into a disaster?</h2>
        <p>
          They used martingale. That is a gambling system where you size up after a
          loss so one win can recover everything you lost before.
        </p>
        <p><strong>What martingale means:</strong></p>
        <ul>
          <li>If you lose, you double down (or size up) next time.</li>
          <li>The logic is that the next win pays back every prior loss.</li>
        </ul>
        <p>
          It sounds mathematically comforting, but it breaks in real life because you
          do not have infinite money, margin, time, or perfect liquidity. The danger
          is not iron condor. The danger is iron condor plus "if I lose I size up
          massively."
        </p>

        <h2>The stats trap they relied on (and why it is misleading)</h2>
        <p>
          The cohort leaned on the idea that roughly 67% to 68% of the time, price
          finishes within one standard deviation of the expected move. That is a
          classic probability assumption from normal distributions.
        </p>
        <p>But real markets do not behave like clean statistical machines:</p>
        <ul>
          <li>Fat tails and sudden jumps show up more often than the model expects.</li>
          <li>Trend days break tidy ranges.</li>
          <li>Holiday liquidity can distort pricing and spreads.</li>
        </ul>
        <p>
          They treated SPX like a casino game with stable odds. It is not.
        </p>

        <h2>The scaling is what killed them</h2>
        <p>
          The system used four levels of sizing: 1 spread, 5 spreads, 17 spreads, and
          53 spreads. In the real market example, those ratios ballooned into tens of
          thousands of contracts.

          </div>
        </div>
        <p>
          Even though each trade is defined risk, the total position risk explodes
          after a few losses. A short losing streak makes size go vertical.

          </div>
        </div>

        <h2>Why Christmas Eve was the "final boss"</h2>
        <p>
          Christmas Eve is a half-day with thin liquidity. That means wider spreads,
          easier price swings, and more extreme hedging flows. The one-day straddle
          was reportedly under $16, signaling a tiny expected move.
        </p>
        <p>
          With SPX around 6,910, the call spread sat only about 10 points above the
          market. A small upward drift was enough to break the range.

            When the range is too tight, a small move can trigger maximum loss.
          </figcaption>
        </figure>

        <h2>The ending</h2>
        <p>
          SPX pushed through the strikes again. The final position went to max loss.
          The account describes the strategy leader losing his capital and a large
          group of followers losing theirs as well (he says roughly 10,000).
        </p>

        <h2>The big lessons (the moral)</h2>
        <ul>
          <li>
            <strong>Lesson 1: Don't sell options at any price.</strong> If premiums are
            too cheap, you are taking real risk for crumbs.
          </li>
          <li>
            <strong>Lesson 2: Know your terrain.</strong> Holiday weeks behave
            differently, and a professional SPX trader would sit out.
          </li>
        </ul>
        <p>
          <strong>The simplest summary:</strong> They paired a defined-risk strategy
          (iron condor) with undefined-risk behavior (martingale sizing), and the
          combination eventually guarantees a blow-up.
